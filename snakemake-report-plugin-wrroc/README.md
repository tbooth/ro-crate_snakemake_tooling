# WRite an R0-Crate with a Snakemake reporter plugin

## Trying out the code.

Easiest way to get this working is to:

1) Create a conda env with the latest Snakemake
2) Make sure that env is active, and that `which pip` looks appropriate
3) `pip install -e ./snakemake-report-plugin-wrroc/`

That's it. No need to mess around with Poetry just to test/hack the code.

## Building and releasing the code

Something something Poetry. Something something distutils.
